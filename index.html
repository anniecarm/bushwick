            <p class="flow-text">Bushwick is a tiny section of Brooklyn stuffed with great food, amazing people, and vintage stores galore. I’ve lived here for two years, but this year some of my closest friends moved within 10 minutes walking distance to me.
            <p>
            <p class="flow-text">In house 1 you have me, my sister Caro, and our friend Maddie. Maddie works in Manhattan, so Caro and I spend more time than her in our little village.
            <p>
            <p class="flow-text">House 2 has Tara, my freshman and sophomore roommate, and spiritual wild woman.
            <p>
            <p class="flow-text">In house 3 has Amanda, Diana, and Matias. Three artists who share a love of Celine Dion, banana bread, and  Mario Kart.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">House 4 has Jess and Stas, who is known to everyone else as ‘Ana’. They used to live in Stuytown, but the rest of us convinced them to ditch Manhattan and come join our urban-suburban lives.</p>

      	<p class="flow-text">This right here is my favorite store in Bushwick.</p>
         <p class="flow-text">Even if I don't plan on buying something, I always stop and look around for a bit whenever I pass by. Outside, I look through the sold items, which always give me fomo, or fear of missing out...like finding an old rotary phone that I would never use but like the idea of.</p>
         <p class="flow-text">Here you can find odds an ends. They have everything from crystal ash trays to balancing bird toys, to earings securing on playing cards.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">But that's not what I come for.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">For me, the main event is their record selection. Out front, they always have bargin bins with records ranging from $2-$5. Inside they can get a bit pricier, but not by much. Any time I walk by, I check my pockets for cash. If on the offchance I have cash, which is rare, I'll decide it's destiny and flip through the LPs until I find a good one.</p>

            <p class="flow-text">Seriously. They even have vegan cheese and gluten free bread. It really doesn't get anymore Bushwick than that. In our family, Tara, Diana, and I frequent at this spot. On a rainy day or on a Tuesday for Triva Night, you can find us here.</P>

         		<p class="flow-text">While my gluten intolerant self can't enjoy their pizza, Caro's vegan self will eat that pizza without cheese because the crust and sauce are "worth it".</p>
         		<p class="flow-text">As far as Jess and Stas go, eat their apartment at any given time I'm bound to find at least three takeout boxes from Archies.</p>
         		<p class="flow-text">Caro's partner, Mike who also lives within a 10 minute walk from us, has a running scheme when it comes to Archies. He's determined to get french fries on the menu, but rather than make a suggestion to someone at the restaurant, he regulary calls and simply asks:</p>

         		<p class="flow-text center">"yeah, can I uh get an order of fries please?"</p>

         		<p class="flow-text">At this point the Archie's employee will explain that they don't serve french fries, and Mike will comment on he swore they served them and then end the conversation.</p>

         		<p class="flow-text">His goal is to slowly wear them down until eventually they believe that the demand for fries is high enough to actually put them on the menu. In the meantime, he tells everyone in Bushwick he meets to ask for fries at Archie's.</p>

         	<p class="flow-text">Households 3, 4, and I go on excursions here every now and then. But I'm there all the time. They have such a random selection with the best probability at finding hidden gems. Plus,they have just racks of levi's and other jeans all $10 and under.</p>
         	<p class="flow-text">My favorite part of this place though is buying clothes from here and then selling them to one of the <i>fancy</i> vintage stores for store credit so I can get some of their higher end stuff for basically a cheap swap.</p>

The best conversations and laughs have been had inside those doors, washed down by Ruby Slippers-my favorite drink.</p>
